# Heroicons

> Heroicon-plus is a statamic addon that adds a new icon fieldtype. 

## Features

This addon does:

- Allows users to select an icon from the preinstalled heroicon library.
- Add additional custom icons through the normal statamic interface. These custom icons share the space with the heroicon icons so you only need one field type for both.


## How to Install

You can install this addon via Composer:

``` bash
composer require technical911/heroicons
```
